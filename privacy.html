CheckMate Privacy Policy
CheckMate does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users. All task data is stored locally on your device. No data is transmitted to any server.

Microphone Usage
CheckMate requests access to your device's microphone (android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO). This permission is solely used to enable voice input for creating tasks and notes, allowing you to speak your entries instead of typing.

All audio processing for this feature is performed locally on your device. The audio data is processed in real-time and immediately discarded after it's converted into text for your task or note. No audio data is collected, stored, or transmitted to any server at any point.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at c.ionut.d@gmail.com
